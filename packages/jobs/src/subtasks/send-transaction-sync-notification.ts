/**
 * Sends notifications for new transactions.
 *
 * @param io - The IO object with integrations, including Supabase client.
 * @param transactions - An array of transaction data from the financial engine.
 * @param teamId - The ID of the team associated with these transactions.
 * @param taskKeyPrefix - A prefix for the task key to ensure uniqueness.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an object indicating whether the operation was successful.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Checks if there are any transactions to process.
 * 2. Logs the number of new transactions being processed.
 * 3. Sends an event notification with transaction details.
 * 4. Returns a success status based on whether transactions were processed.
 *
 * The function uses the `io.runTask` method to execute the notification process,
 * ensuring proper tracking and management of the subtask within the larger workflow.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await sendTransactionsNotificationSubTask(
 *   io,
 *   transactions,
 *   'team-123',
 *   'daily-sync'
 * );
 * console.log(result.success); // true if notifications were sent, false otherwise
 * ```
