/**
 * Defines a job to remove transactions older than 1 year for all teams.
 *
 * This job is scheduled to run monthly and performs the following steps:
 * 1. Calculates the cutoff date (1 year ago from the current date).
 * 2. Retrieves all teams from the database in batches.
 * 3. For each team, removes transactions older than the cutoff date in batches.
 * 4. Returns a summary of the number of transactions removed for each team.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This job uses the Trigger.dev framework for job definition and execution.
 * It integrates with Supabase for data retrieval and deletion.
 * The job is designed to handle large numbers of transactions and teams efficiently by processing them in batches.
 *
 * @example
 * This job is triggered automatically by the cron schedule. To manually trigger it, you can use:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { client } from "@/path/to/trigger-client";
 * import { Jobs } from "@/path/to/constants";
 *
 * const triggerRemoveOldTransactions = async () => {
 *   await client.runJob({
 *     id: Jobs.REMOVE_OLD_TRANSACTIONS,
 *   });
 *
 *   console.log("Remove old transactions job triggered");
 * };
 *
 * triggerRemoveOldTransactions();
 * ```
